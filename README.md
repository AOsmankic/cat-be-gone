# Cat Be Gone
A simple project to use a nano pi neo and arudino to attempt to scare a cat everytime it goes on a counter top.

The project uses opencv and some simple image recognition to attempt to identify when a cat enters the field of view of a given camera. If a cat is visible, the arudino will trigger a speaker to attempt to scare the cat of the counter.
